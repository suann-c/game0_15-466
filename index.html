<h1>Tessellate</h1>
<p>Like Candy Crush except the player gets as many moves as they want.</p>

<p> This game is played on a 4x5 board. There are star squares and empty squares. The goal is to move around squares on the board until all star squares are touching edges with each other.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>Start: Each level is randomly generated and must have at least two star squares and one empty square. It is possible for all star squares to spawn with touching edges, in which case the player gets a free win.
Movement: Player clicks on a square that they want to move and press an arrow key to attempt to move the selected square. An empty square cannot be selected. A selected square cannot move in a certain direction if there is a square in its way.
Finish: The round ends either when the player gets all star square edges touching or when they reset the level by pressing "r".</p>
